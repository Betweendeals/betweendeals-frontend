# Features Directory

This directory contains all business domain features organized in a feature-first architecture. Each feature represents a complete business capability with its own components, pages, hooks, services, and types.

## 📁 Structure Overview

```
features/
├── authentication/         # User login, registration, password management
├── marketplace/           # Business browsing, search, listing details
├── business-dashboard/    # Seller tools, listing management, analytics
├── user-profile/         # Personal settings, account management
├── messaging/            # Communication between buyers and sellers
└── landing/              # Marketing pages, home, about, pricing
```

## 🎯 Feature Architecture

Each feature follows this consistent structure:

```
feature-name/
├── components/           # Feature-specific UI components
├── pages/               # Route components for this feature
├── hooks/               # Custom hooks for feature logic
├── services/            # API calls and business logic
├── types/               # TypeScript interfaces for this feature
└── README.md            # Feature documentation
```

## 🔄 Feature Principles

### 1. **Self-Contained**

Each feature contains everything it needs to function:

- UI components specific to the feature
- Business logic and state management
- API integration and data handling
- Type definitions

### 2. **Minimal Dependencies**

Features should:

- Import from shared components when needed
- Avoid importing from other features
- Use shared services for cross-cutting concerns
- Maintain clear boundaries

### 3. **Consistent Structure**

All features follow the same organizational pattern:

- Makes it easy for developers to navigate
- Reduces cognitive load when switching features
- Enables better code reviews and maintenance

## 🏗️ Adding New Features

When creating a new feature:

1. **Create the directory structure**

```bash
mkdir src/features/new-feature
mkdir src/features/new-feature/{components,pages,hooks,services,types}
```

2. **Add feature README**
   Document the feature's purpose, components, and API

3. **Create index.ts files**
   Export the main components and utilities

4. **Update routing**
   Add routes in `src/app/routing/router.tsx`

5. **Add navigation**
   Update sidebar/header navigation if needed

## 📦 Feature Exports

Each feature should export its public interface through `index.ts` files:

```typescript
// Good: Clean public interface
export { LoginPage } from './pages/LoginPage';
export { useAuth } from './hooks/useAuth';
export { AuthService } from './services/AuthService';

// Avoid: Exporting internal components
export { InternalAuthComponent } from './components/InternalAuthComponent';
```

## 🔗 Inter-Feature Communication

### ✅ Recommended Patterns

1. **Shared Services**: Use services from `src/shared/services/`
2. **Context Providers**: Global state through app providers
3. **URL Parameters**: Pass data through routing
4. **Events**: Custom events for loose coupling

### ❌ Anti-Patterns

1. **Direct Imports**: Don't import from other features
2. **Tight Coupling**: Avoid direct dependencies between features
3. **Shared State**: Don't share feature-specific state

## 🧪 Testing Features

Each feature should include:

```
feature-name/
├── __tests__/           # Feature-specific tests
├── components/
│   └── Button.test.tsx  # Component tests
├── hooks/
│   └── useAuth.test.ts  # Hook tests
└── services/
    └── api.test.ts      # Service tests
```

## 📋 Feature Checklist

When implementing a feature, ensure:

- [ ] All components are properly typed
- [ ] Error boundaries are implemented
- [ ] Loading states are handled
- [ ] Responsive design is implemented
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is complete

## 🎨 UI Consistency

Features should use:

- Shared components from `src/shared/components/`
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Standard color palette
- Common interaction patterns

## 🔐 Security Considerations

For features handling sensitive data:

- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize user content
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Handle permissions appropriately
- Log security-relevant events

## 📈 Performance Guidelines

- Lazy load feature routes
- Optimize bundle sizes
- Use proper caching strategies
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Monitor and measure performance
